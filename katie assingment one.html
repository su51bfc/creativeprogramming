	<p>Evaluation <br> For this assignment i have created a shooting star in the night sky, using canvas.<br> I have done a static image and a moving image to show i can create a still image as well as animated images.<br>The reason i decided to create the shooting star is because i am still not every confident with coding <br> so to create a shooting star in the night sky would be quite simple to do but still be effective.<br> For the shooting star i have coloured it in yellow, i did this so you can easily tell which is the shooting star against the other stars<br>I have chosen to use the circle shape for my stars because i did have a little trouble getting another shape to show on the canvas. <br> The shooting star moves from left to right at the top of the canvas with all the other white stars underneath.<br> all the other stars are coloured in white, i did this to help them stand out against the black background.<br> For the colours of the stars i decided to use the words of the colours rather than the hexadecimal numbers,<br> i did this because the numbers didn't seem to work how i wanted them too <br>I have tried to space out the white stars as well as i could and make them different sizes too.<br> I did this to try and create the effect of stars in the night sky with the stars at different distances to the viewer .<br> Even though the images are basic and my coding skills are not great, i am pleased with what i have managed to create.<br>While creating the code most things did go to plan however i did have a little trouble on the positions of the white stars <br> and the hexadecimal numbers for the colours.<br> I wanted to space the stars out evenly but i kept getting confused with what numbers changed what.<br>And i wanted to use hexadecimal numbers but this was unsuccessfull. <br> However after playing around with the numbers in the code i was able to space out the stars in a way i was happy with<br> and for the colours i just decided to use the words instead of the hexadecimal numbers.<br>To make the animation work i used one function as i only wanted to animate one star. I did this by using an x and a y position <br> To help me achieve this i referred to all the code that we learnt in lectures as well as the youtube video html 5 canvas tutorial <br><br> Reference <br> Rosser, Z.
